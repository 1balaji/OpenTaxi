********************************
** OpenTaxi client-server API **
********************************

====================
= HTTP API request =
====================
HTTP POST request to URL: http://<hostname.tld>/api/<method>
Content-Type: text/json
HTTP POST content must be a valid JSON-encoded request data.
Minimal required request data is:
{
 "id": user_id, // user's phone number without "+" sign, expressed as integer number, 11 or 12 digits
 "signature": "" // SHA1 ( method name + id + SHA1 ( password ) + (UTC unix timestamp)/10 ).
}
Returned data always contain:
{
 "err": result, // result code, integer. 0 is OK.
 "errmsg": "" // optional, error message
}

IMPORTANT!
In order to generate valid signature the client must be somewhat synchrinized with the server (usually
+/-20sec clock skew is appropriate).
Server usually uses NTP (GPS or even local atomic clock may be an option).
Client can use any synchronization method (NTP, GPS, GSM etc), but it is recommended to check server's
timestamp using the sync helper (see below) to ensure good sync.

====================
= Method reference =
====================

Common request rules
====================
Parameters described must be merged with minimal request data.

Common errors
=============
400 - Bad request (syntax error, required fields absent etc)
401 - Bad signature (clock skew too large, wrong id and/or password or user blocked). No "errmsg".
411 - CAPTCHA required (request rate is too high). No "errmsg".
500 - Internal server error

Handling user proprietary data
==============================
Proprietary data objects (PD) are designed for client-side extensions. If client software needs to store
some data about user or UI settings, it can use PD.
PD are of two types: private and public. Private is available for user itself only. Public is sent to
everyone registered user by "user/get" request.
PD size is limited (16kb by default). Do not use it for images, audio, video etc.
PD is stored and transferred as an object. Best approach is to store each extension's proprietary data
in separate object.
Client software must be aware of PD. When updating user data, it must send all PD back to server, or
else PD will be destroyed.
