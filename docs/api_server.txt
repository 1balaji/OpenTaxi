*************************
** OpenTaxi server API **
*************************

Method implementation scripts are stored in "api" directory, in appropriate subdirectories and are named "index.php", like this:
/
 +api
 | +car
 | | +list_colors
 | | | -index.php
 | | +list_models
 | |   -index.php
 | +order
 | | +accept
 | |   -index.php
 ...

This is to avoid URL rewriting and easily use servers like lighttpd or nginx.

First 3 lines of the script must be:

<?php
global $DB, $RQ, $USER;
require_once('../../../inc/bootstrap.inc.php');

Bootstrap script checks the validity of client-server API request and parses it.
On success, connects to database, retrieves user data and checks the signature.

3 global variables are available after bootstrap:
* $DB - MongoDB class instance connected to "opentaxi" DB
* $RQ - API request as an associative array
* $USER - Authenticated user's data as an associative array

Script template can be found in "docs/api_server_method_template" directory of this distribution.
