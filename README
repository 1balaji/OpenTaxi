** OpenTaxi project **

Project overview
================
This project is aimed to automate taxi service and make it open to everybody.
Every car driver has the right to take a passenger along the way, bring him/her to his/her destination
and earn some money from this.
Every passenger have the right to get the ride with such driver.
So let's bring them together.

Author of this project had some experience with commercial taxi service automation programs. They're ugly.
The market needs a good, agile and sane product. Let's do it together for everyone.

This project will start as the local service helper.
